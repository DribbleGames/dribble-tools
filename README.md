# dribble-tools
Collection of generic utilities and extensions to facilitate game development in Unity3d

## How to use
With Git (recommended for easy updates):
1. Open a command window and navigate to wherever you want this code to live. I prefer `Assets` or `Assets/Scripts` but anywhere should be fine.
2. Run `git clone git@github.com:DribbleGames/dribble-tools.git`
3. That's it! You should now have access to all the scripts.

Without Git:
1. Download the contents of this repository into your project Assets folder. 
2. To update, repeat step 1.

## Compatibility
This project uses `.asmdef` files so tell Unity to skip recompilation when you make changes in your projects. This was introduced in `2017.3` so if you're using an older version, either update your project or delete the `.asmdef` files. Everything should still work.
